# GuessTheCapitalcityByTheWeather
I developed this project using https://openweathermap.org. When you downloaded the file , type in terminal npm i, to install packages, then you can npm run dev, to run it in localhost. Don't forget to paste OpenWeatherMap api key in the code const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
